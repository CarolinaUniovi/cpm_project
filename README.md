This applicatio was developed for the subject Human Computer Interaction. To run the project, go to MODULE-PL-I-3-Carolina-Barrios/src/cpm/module/Main.java in Eclipse or some simmilar application and run it.\n
The introduction offered by the teachers of the subject is the following:
It seems that, so far this year, an alarming increase in paranormal activity has been detected in various
castles in Europe. Experts in the subject have documented chilling events such as apparitions, movement
of objects, turning lights on and off, sounds of footsteps through hallways and ceilings...
Beyond being intimidated, the owners of a good part of these castles have been delighted at the potential
business, taking advantage of the boom in the Halloween celebration in Europe. So, a company that is
going to manage the reservation of these castles hires us to develop a desktop application that facilitates
the reservation. Furthermore, to celebrate the launching of the application, any customer who participates
in a game included in the project will be able to obtain substantial discounts on the final amount of the
reservation, as it will be described in the following sections of this document.
